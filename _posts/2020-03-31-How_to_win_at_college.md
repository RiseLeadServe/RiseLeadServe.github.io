##### CH 1: Don’t do all of your reading
Skim the chapter ahead of class but put the bulk of your energy into concentrating in class.

Class lectures + HW problems are more effective than class lectures + readings.

##### CH 2: Create a Sunday ritual
Sunday sets the tone for the week that follows. You can build momentum on Sunday that
carries you through the day.

Engage in the same focusing ritual every Sunday morning. With peak intellectual energy +
strong focus start working.

Take control of Sunday to take control of the week.

##### CH 3: Drop classes every semester
Avoid bad courses at all costs- unreasonable requirements or bad professors.

Sign up for 2 / 3 extra ones and drop your least favourites. Check the professor’s teaching,
syllabi, required materials & workload from previous students.

##### CH 4: Start long term projects the day they are assigned
Finish some amount of work on a big project the very day it’s assigned (> 30 mins or so).

Because of this, you’re ahead! And this makes you want to stay ahead and reduce the
tendency to delay. Start small but start immediately!

##### CH 5: Make your bed
Make it an unbreakable habit and never leave clothes around.

A clean room creates a focused mind and a messy room creates a distracted mind and
makes it really hard to be energised.

Also, never truly feels like your life’s organised.

##### CH 6: Apply to 10 scholarships a year
Any student can create an impressively large list of awards.

Search for scholarships and awards related to you or at companies that interest you.

Find 10 and just apply blindly every year.

##### CH 7: Build study systems
Never begin studying without a systemised plan for what you’re going to review, in what
format and how many times. Why? It breaks up a formidable task into accomplishable
chunks. It frees up energy to focus on learning rather than on the state of preparation.

Build a checklist with big boxes ready to be checked off. Why? Free from worry about being
ready or not.

Make interesting and comprehensive study systems. Why? Without a study system, a lot of
time and energy is wasted.

Planning is as important as the process.

##### CH 8: Befriend a professor
If you want to become a standout student you must befriend a professor.

Make them your mentor, and aware of your overall academic plan, life goals, concerns and
triumphs.

Letters of recommendation, informal introductions, expert advice and nominations for
awards are all wonderful things to come out of this.

Spend time at their office or discuss homework problems or different ideas and build a
strong rapport. Keep in touch and take their courses.

##### CH 9: Become a club president
You absolutely have to run a campus organisation. Find a club that excites you, join soon,
work hard, attend all meetings, take up a position and develop a strong idea for it.

##### CH 10: Read a newspaper every day
Expand your intellectual horizons- international & domestic affairs, politics, business or fine
arts.

##### CH 11: Do one thing better than everyone else you know
Develop a skill you can be known for. Guitar, writing, shooting hoops or cooking. Be
self-assured, proud and modest.

It helps you develop a healthy & stable sense of self.

Do very little that is ordinary.

##### CH 12: Avoid daily to-do lists
Your schedule just might be too complicated & unpredictable. Daily to-do s might bog you
down.

Opt for a more flexible scheduling method.

##### CH 13: Learn to give up
Giving up is a tactical skill, not a weakness. Unreasonable commitments and unsolvable
problems can be delegated or step down and seek help respectively.

Productive work is any work that is efficiently accomplished in a known amount of work.

##### CH 14: Never nap
Takes up large amounts of limited time and leaves you drowsy & unfocused. Also, throws
you off your sleep schedule and eventually becomes an addictive bad habit.

An alternate way to re-energize: Go outside / play a game for a while / brisk walk to get
your heart pumping.

Snack on fresh fruits and ice cold water to build a streak of energy.

Do simple tasks when drowsy and head to bed early instead.

##### CH 15: Sign up for something your first week

##### CH 16:Always be working on a ‘grand project’
Something common between successful, intelligent students is a wonderful sense of
possibility. Get excited about BIG goals!

Have an ‘Anything is possible’ attitude and constantly work on a grand project. If you could
be anything in 5 years from now what would it be? Something that elicits a ‘Wow!’ response.

##### CH 17: Take art history & astronomy

##### CH 18: Blow the curve once a term
Stand way out for 1 assignment per course. Impress the professor and .... And in a class
that excites you and not too many competing obligations.

##### CH 19: Ask one question every lecture
One of the most effective ways to stay engaged and interested during lectures.

##### CH 20: Jump into research as soon as possible
Research is where all the action is.

It’s strength training for your intellect, impressive and gives you the opportunity to build a
close rapport with a professor.

##### CH 21: Pay your dues

If you pay your dues with grace and enthusiasm and be mindful of the opposites. Maximise
the positive benefits of participating.

##### CH 22: Study in 50 min chunks
50 min chunks is the most efficient way of learning material possible for the human brain.

##### CH 23: Schedule your free time
It’s dangerously easy to lose too much productivity to the allure of recreation and feel guilty
every time you relax.

Set 10 pm as the end of your workday with no impromptu breaks. This could help you relax
better.

##### CH 24: Dress nicely for class
It makes you feel better about yourself and makes the day official.

##### CH 25: Decorate your room
Your room decor should create a space that is both comfortable and a healthy reflection of
your personality. It helps in improving performance and not sap your energy.

##### CH 26: Start studying 2 weeks in advance as a rule of thumb
No hardcore all-day study sessions! Break up 15hrs into 2-hour chunks over 2 weeks.

For the 1st week spend an hour or so every day. Do small chunks of work to get familiar
with the material and a good feel for the information. Clock in some extra hours over the
weekend.

Over the 2nd week, spend 1 or 2 hrs per day. Rack up review hours and over the last 2 days
spend 3hr sessions to cement the material.

##### CH 27: Write outside of class
Become really good at writing and take every opportunity to do so.

##### CH 28: Eat alone twice a day
Take the time to eat a social meal but just once.

##### CH 29: Find an escape
You need to journey to a place where you will be cut off from everyday student life.

Schedule an escape every single week.

##### CH 30: Take hard courses early on
Start taking higher-level classes ASAP after checking prerequisites.

##### CH 31: Don’t study in your room
Weigh convenience against the effectiveness of studying. Study at the library instead which
is designed to maximise academic productivity.

##### CH 32: Don’t study in groups
Best way to learn difficult material is to go over it yourself as you test your concentration.

Test your understanding or specific problem with a study group.

##### CH 33: Join an honours program
Better education than the regular academic program in the same time.

##### CH 34: Do school work every day
Key to preventing bad slumps is consistency. When you take long breaks from work it’s
harder to get back to the rhythm.

Do some amount of work every day which leaves you motivated every day!

##### CH 35: Attend guest lectures
Try to attend at least 2 every month.

They inspire you, ignite a passion within yourself and leave you stoked.

##### CH 36: Exercise 5 days a week
It increases physical energy and mental motivation.

Don’t let exercise become debatable.

Early morning or afternoons are optimal as there are fewer distractions.

On Mon, Wed, Fri always go to the gym at the exact same time and for the same duration.

For optimal energy and health stick to a 1-hour routine.

On Tue, Thurs engage in some cardio and on Sat and Sun, some light supplementary
workout will do.

##### CH 37: Stay in touch
Stay in touch not only with your family but also friends back home.

##### CH 38: Take on an extra major/minor
Plan well and plan early

##### CH 39: Meet often with your advisor

##### CH 41: Use 3 days to write a paper (short ones)
3 days aren’t for research or collecting material but actually writing. Before you begin, draw
an outline and write a thesis.

Day 1- Power through the outline and build rough drafts of the paper

Day 2- Tighten the wording. Remove any excess arguments, redundant parts and add
support to those.

Day 3- Polish. Make sure the paper flows logically and check the grammar, introduction and
conclusion.

##### CH 42: Don’t undersleep don’t oversleep
Once you have a magic number of sleep hours, keep to it consistently.

##### CH 43: Relax before exams
You need to put in relaxation time to function under pressure. Instead of being jittery,
unfocused or with too much adrenaline, an hour before the exam just relax and be
confident and calm.

##### CH 44: Make friends #1 priority
Never take your friends for granted; they're your social safety net.

Don’t let busy schedules come between you and your friends. If a good friend needs you,
drop everything and go.

##### CH 46: Ignore your classmates’ grades
Too many factors and contributions lead up to individuals’ grades.

##### CH 47: Seek out phenomenal achievers
They’re not only a source of inspiration but also show you ways to achieve similar goals.

##### CH 48: Learn to listen
Much more important that you spend your undergraduate developing an ability to
synthesize ideas and learn- Constructive debates!

Never be the 1st to give your opinion it not only increases respect for you but also gives
you the opportunity to learn from the debates.

##### CH 49: Never pull an all-nighter!
After 2 am your mental ability is practically dead like it’s inside of a toaster oven. And on
top of everything you are, for all purposes, a zombie tomorrow.

A seriously sleep-deprived mind is equivalent to a fully asleep brain and your academic
performance is badly affected by it.

##### CH 50: LAUGH EVERY DAY

##### CH 51: Use high- quality notebooks
A need to search to find information decreases the retention of material.

Highly organised and high-quality supplies are mental cues for serious work.

##### CH 52: Keep a work progress journal
Most advantages of starting work early are diminished if you don’t work regularly once
you’ve begun

Every night just jot down what work you’ve accomplished that day towards a long-term
goal.

##### CH 53: Seek out fun
Sophomore slump - Immediately after 1st year

##### CH 54: Inflate your ambition
Inventory your goals- Does it make you stand out? Award nominations? Prompt a professor
to mention your name?

##### CH 55: Get involved with your major department

##### CH 56: Care about your grades, ignore your GPA
Thinking about your GPA can derail you from larger goals.

Every test is an opportunity to show off your ability to engage. Every paper is an exercise in
crafting words.

##### CH 57: Always go to class
Go to class no matter the circumstance- unless you’re sick.

##### CH 58: Set arbitrary deadlines
Always break down big tasks into small ones and set deadlines for those.

##### CH 59: Eat healthily
Eat to maximise your energy. For weekdays, food is nothing but fuel.

##### CH 60: Volunteer quietly
Keep your experience personal as a way to increase your self-worth, strengthen your
identity and solidify your core values.

##### CH 61: Write as if going for a Pulitzer for explanatory reporting

##### CH 62: Attend political discussions
This is the only time in your life when you have enough.......

##### CH 63: Maximise your summers
Summer vacation isn’t really a vacation but an annually occurring grace period. Focus fully
on non-academic ambitions and experiences.

To work or not to work? Official paid internship / part-time job/ research assistant / paid
publication internships / small jobs at local publications / create opportunities for yourself.

Search all big names in your field of interest and shadow them.

##### CH 64: Choose goals and explore routes
Remain inflexible in your pursuits. Branch out and try multiple related paths.

Once you’ve decided on a destination, explore many routes to get you there.

##### CH 65: Don’t take breaks between classes
It slows down built momentum to a halt. You can’t waste energy by repeatedly remotivating
yourself. Use the time in between to do stuff you need to like chores or errands.

It also lets you hit the evening with the day’s smaller responsibilities done!

##### CH 66: Don’t network
The act of purposefully expanding your acquaintances’ circle is very time-consuming. Leave
networking to business professionals.

The idea of mutual benefit fails. Instead, chose anti-network: getting what you want by
never coming close to asking for it.

Just be curious about why that person is doing this? What is he doing? How? Show
confidence and respect. Drop differences to lay the path for memorable conversation.

Periodically send an update email asking very well-informed relevant questions/advice
without any favours. Impress without imploring!

Let them grow fond of you and impress with integrity. This builds up strong connections.

##### CH 67: Publish Op-Eds
On any forum for student voices once every semester.

Choose a topic you know a lot about. Polish your prose and choose controversial (maybe)
topics and catch readers off guard. Highlight issues never mentioned before.

##### CH 68: Using a filing cabinet
Buy a filing cabinet. Never lose anything important which increases stress levels
unnecessarily, unsettles us or causes undue frustration.

Worry about the big problems of academic life and don’t let other small things steal your
energy.

##### CH 69: Find a secret study space
It takes a lot of effort to achieve the concentration needed to learn.

Use the space sparingly and don’t associate discomfort with the study.

Make sure the space is well-lit.

##### CH 70: Study with the quiz-and-recall method
Build your entire approach to studying around the concept that, making yourself recall
specific information is the absolute best way to learn.

Draw a quiz for each concept and ace these quizzes without peeking at your notes.

It’s basically a 2 step process:

1. A long and silent review of the material where you jot down the review questions

2. Quizzing

The art of pulling the information from your memory and articulating cements knowledge
much stronger than multiple readings.

Trick! Use emotions. Don’t sit and mumble at your desk. Pace your room and give answers
out loud. This gives more stimuli to the brain which, in turn, leads to the development of
more connections to the material to help you remember and understand it better.

##### CH 71: Empty your inbox
Organise messages in your email inbox like in paper files.

Every email that you read make sure you either trash or file it.

##### CH 72: Relax before you sleep
Relax for at least 30 mins before you go to sleep. This indicates a cut-off point for your
work. Don’t spend it on schoolwork.

After you’re done with work never move right into sleep because then you’ll have a harder
time falling asleep.

Give your mind a chance to recover from pressures of the day.

Talk to a friend/ family, read/play a board/video game. Watch an episode of a TV show that
makes you happy.

You’ll also sleep better, happier and you’ll have more energy next day.

Work lost to night time relaxation is more than compensated by your refreshed spirit.

##### CH 73: Start fast, end slow
Don’t go with start slow, end fast.

##### CH 74: Spend a semester studying abroad
Explore the world when young and take in other cultures, learn a new language and gain a
huge new perspective on life.

Never again in your life will you possibly spend so much time overseas.

Truly understanding another culture is a life changing experience and picking up new
languages is good for the resume and a wonderful skill.

Don’t let it pass you by.

##### CH 75: Don’t have any regrets
Approach life with a sense of excitement and possibility. Be happy about your
opportunities not successes.

Succeeding for attention or to prove something to others or because you enjoy praise can’t
help you because the fear of failure is lurking right around the corner.

If you fail, why waste time with regrets? Be thankful and ask what’s next?

Always have a hopeful smile on your face.
