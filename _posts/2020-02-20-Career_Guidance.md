# IIT Madras offering Career Guidance to Government school students with the CSR Support from NSFDC.

Most students in India enter their undergraduate studies without really have chosen their courses themselves. As a result, at the end of graduation, they end up not knowing what to do and their employability is becoming a key challenge.  Instead of pursuing a career of their choice and interest, a student’s aspiration, very often, is fuelled by the pressure to meet parental and societal expectations. Career guidance, therefore, it is absolutely necessary in India because students need to be mentally prepared to face the world after graduation. We want to work together to create youngsters who have a positive outlook towards life, while also being responsible and accountable for themselves. As part of this career guidance initiative, we want to request parents to work with the schools closely to understand the student’s interests and capabilities.

With MCMF Indian Language Editions, students and professionals can self-assess their personality in seven major Indian languages – Hindi, Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu, besides English. MCMF Indian language editions fill a long-felt gap in career guidance tools that cater to non-English speaking populations in India. MCMF was developed by BodhBridge ESPL, in collaboration with senior professors and researchers at the Department of Management Studies, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. BodhBridge ESPL is an educational services company that was incubated by IIT Madras. MCMF assesses an individual on twelve personality traits. These twelve are classified into four basic personality traits and eight career-oriented personality traits. The basic personality traits are important irrespective of the career path an individual wishes to pursue.  The career-oriented personality traits are related to career domains.  Each personality trait is measured by six dimensions. At the end of the 30-minute assessment, test takers promptly receive an automatically-generated, comprehensive and personalized personality report.


The following parameters used as part of the MCMF Career Guidance Framework:
1.	Interest and Personality (Psychometric Test)
2.	Academic Performance (understanding the student’s strengths)
3.	Interest - personality - academic performance match
4.	Extra-curricular and Co-curricular activities
5.	Achievement or Hidden talents (typically ignored in the academic environment)
