Here are two remarkable  instances of individuals who have achieved success in life with assistance 
from ILP. www.ilpnet.org/


Tamilarasan is from first batch scholarship students supported by ILP Chennai chapter. He was identified from the brick kiln when he was engaged with labor work of loading the bricks. He expressed interest to study and thus he started his journey into college education. He joined his B.Sc. Chemistry in the year 2014 and he was constantly mentored during his college days.  He completed his graduation (2014-17) and came out as class topper with a distinction. That was a proud moment for his parents and our organization.

He is also interested in pursuing his National Eligibility Test (NET) for becoming a teaching faculty in higher education and also doing Ph.D.

Saraswathi our ILP staff comes from a humble background. She completed her Engineering (2010-14)and worked in a Software Company. Her heart was more towards social service, teaching and working with children and hence decided to join a NGO. She worked with another NGO for short duration before joining our organization.

The school has exceled in its library program. At present; she is the facilitating MDLS program through a partner NGO of ILP i.e. IRCDS in 6 blocks, which has 18 MDLS and 13 libraries.  She is an honest person and has a good rapport with the students and teachers easily.
